## isPalindrome

Just a bit of Java interview practice after an hilarious attempt to code for two intercviewing developers. Idecided to retry the simple challenge on my own for some practice. My origianl solution reversed the string input to check if it was the same as the input string, this version uses a while loop to check each char from either end of the string to find if they all match.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
